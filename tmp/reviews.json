I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request significantly enhances the robustness of the CLI's output mechanisms by transitioning from a 'log and continue' error handling strategy to a comprehensive error propagation model. It introduces a new, unified approach to output formatting, ensuring that all output operations are atomic and errors are properly surfaced throughout the application, leading to more reliable and predictable behavior.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Error Handling Refactor**: All output functions now propagate errors instead of logging and continuing, establishing a clear error propagation chain through the entire output stack (formatter → printTableData → printResult → displayResult → executeStatement).\n* **Output Formatting Abstraction**: Introduced a `FormatFunc` type and refactored all formatters (Table, Vertical, Tab, CSV, HTML, XML) to be simple functions, replacing previous struct-based approaches and consolidating related logic.\n* **Atomic Output**: Implemented a `writeBuffered` helper function to ensure atomic output, preventing partial data writes to the output stream in case of errors during formatting.\n* **Code Organization**: Moved all specific output formatting logic into a new `formatters.go` file, improving modularity and separation of concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point in your pull request via creating an issue comment (i.e. comment on the pull request page) using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`. Below is a summary of the supported commands.\n\nFeature | Command | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nCode Review | `/gemini review` | Performs a code review for the current pull request in its current state.\nPull Request Summary | `/gemini summary` | Provides a summary of the current pull request in its current state.\nComment | @gemini-code-assist | Responds in comments when explicitly tagged, both in issue comments and review comments.\nHelp | `/gemini help` | Displays a list of available commands.\n\n<b>Customization</b>\n\nTo customize Gemini Code Assist for GitHub experience, repository maintainers can create a configuration file and/or provide a custom code review style guide (such as PEP-8 for Python) by creating and adding files to a `.gemini/` folder in the base of the repository. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/customize-gemini-behavior-github).\n\n<b>Limitations & Feedback</b>\n\nGemini Code Assist may make mistakes.
