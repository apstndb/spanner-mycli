## Summary of Changes

Hello @apstndb, I'm Gemini Code Assist! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request significantly enhances the robustness of the CLI's output mechanisms by transitioning from a 'log and continue' error handling strategy to a comprehensive error propagation model. It introduces a new, unified approach to output formatting, ensuring that all output operations are atomic and errors are properly surfaced throughout the application, leading to more reliable and predictable behavior.

### Highlights

* **Error Handling Refactor**: All output functions now propagate errors instead of logging and continuing, establishing a clear error propagation chain through the entire output stack (formatter → printTableData → printResult → displayResult → executeStatement).
* **Output Formatting Abstraction**: Introduced a `FormatFunc` type and refactored all formatters (Table, Vertical, Tab, CSV, HTML, XML) to be simple functions, replacing previous struct-based approaches and consolidating related logic.
* **Atomic Output**: Implemented a `writeBuffered` helper function to ensure atomic output, preventing partial data writes to the output stream in case of errors during formatting.
* **Code Organization**: Moved all specific output formatting logic into a new `formatters.go` file, improving modularity and separation of concerns.

## Code Review

This is a fantastic refactoring that significantly improves error handling in the output functions. The new design using `FormatFunc` and `NewFormatter` is clean and scalable. I've added a few comments on the new `formatters.go` file to suggest making the error checking even more comprehensive and robust, in line with the excellent direction of this PR.

## Code Review

This pull request introduces proper error handling and propagation in the output functions, a significant improvement over the previous 'log and continue' pattern. The `FormatFunc` type and the `formatters.go` file enhance modularity and maintainability. My review ensures consistent error handling and alignment with the project's style guide, particularly regarding memory patterns (streaming vs. buffering) for specific formatters.

## All Review Threads (6 total, all resolved)

### Thread 1: Unchecked fmt.Fprintln error in formatTable
- **File**: formatters.go, line 127
- **Priority**: High
- **Issue**: fmt.Fprintln call error not checked
- **Resolution**: Fixed in commit e4bb3dd - added error check for fmt.Fprintln

### Thread 2: Unchecked fmt.Fprintf errors in formatVertical  
- **File**: formatters.go, lines 154-166
- **Priority**: High
- **Issue**: Multiple fmt.Fprintf calls with unchecked errors
- **Resolution**: Fixed in commit e4bb3dd - added error checks for all fmt.Fprintf calls

### Thread 3: Unchecked fmt.Fprint/Fprintf errors in formatHTML
- **File**: formatters.go, lines 231-262
- **Priority**: High  
- **Issue**: Multiple fmt.Fprint and fmt.Fprintf calls with unchecked errors
- **Resolution**: Fixed in commit e4bb3dd - added error checks for all fmt.Fprint/Fprintf calls

### Thread 4: Unchecked fmt.Fprintln errors in formatXML
- **File**: formatters.go, lines 329-339
- **Priority**: High
- **Issue**: fmt.Fprintln calls ignore potential errors
- **Resolution**: Fixed in commit e4bb3dd - added error checks for both fmt.Fprintln calls

### Thread 5: formatVertical using buffered format instead of streaming
- **File**: formatters.go, line 139
- **Priority**: High
- **Issue**: Using writeBuffered contradicts style guide which specifies VERTICAL should be streaming
- **Resolution**: Fixed in commit f116390 - removed writeBuffered and made formatVertical a streaming format

### Thread 6: formatHTML using buffered format instead of streaming
- **File**: formatters.go, line 226
- **Priority**: High
- **Issue**: Using writeBuffered contradicts style guide which specifies HTML should be streaming
- **Resolution**: Fixed in commit f116390 - removed writeBuffered and made formatHTML a streaming format

## Summary

All review feedback has been addressed:
- First round: 4 high-priority issues about unchecked errors → Fixed in commit e4bb3dd
- Second round: 2 high-priority issues about streaming vs buffering → Fixed in commit f116390

The PR successfully improves error handling throughout the output functions and aligns with the project's style guide for streaming formats.
