# Development Flow Insights

This document captures development patterns, best practices, and lessons learned from implementing features in spanner-mycli.

## Parallel Issue Development with Phantom

**Discovery**: Using phantom worktrees enables efficient parallel development of multiple low-hanging fruit issues

- **Workflow**: Create multiple worktrees simultaneously (`issue-245`, `issue-243`, `issue-241`, etc.)
- **tmux Integration**: Different layout strategies (window/horizontal/vertical) optimize screen space usage
- **Independent Testing**: Each worktree maintains separate build artifacts and test state
- **Context Switching**: No rebuild costs when switching between issues
- **Knowledge Capture**: `.worktree-knowledge.md` enables systematic capture of insights

### Automated Setup

Use the provided script for consistent worktree setup:

```bash
# Automated setup (recommended)
bin/spanner-mycli-dev worktree setup issue-276-timeout-flag

# Manual setup (for reference)
phantom create issue-276-timeout-flag --exec 'ln -sf ../../../../.claude .claude'
```

### Path Structure Explanation

**Phantom worktree directory structure:**
```
/home/user/spanner-mycli/                    # Repository root
├── .claude/                                 # Claude settings directory
└── .git/phantom/worktrees/<worktree-name>/  # Phantom worktree location
```

**Symlink path breakdown (`../../../../.claude`):**
- `../` → `/home/user/spanner-mycli/.git/phantom/worktrees/`
- `../../` → `/home/user/spanner-mycli/.git/phantom/`
- `../../../` → `/home/user/spanner-mycli/.git/`
- `../../../../` → `/home/user/spanner-mycli/` (repository root)
- `../../../../.claude` → `/home/user/spanner-mycli/.claude/`
phantom shell issue-276-timeout-flag --tmux-horizontal
```

## Error Handling Architecture Evolution

**Discovery**: Systematic replacement of panics with proper error handling improves system robustness

- **Architecture Impact**: Moving from panic-driven failure to graceful error propagation
- **System Boundary**: Clear distinction between "programming errors" (should panic) vs "runtime conditions" (should return errors)
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive nil checks and error condition testing becomes critical
- **Maintenance**: Error handling patterns should be consistent across similar components

## Systematic Error Detection and Quality Improvement

**Discovery**: Comprehensive error handling review reveals patterns and establishes sustainable practices

- **Detection Strategy**: Use `rg "_, _ ="` and `rg "ignoreError"` for systematic scanning of ignored errors
- **Three-Tier Improvement**: Silent failure → warning logs → contextual logging with relevant data
- **Contextual Information Priority**: Include SQL statements, proto type names, and operation context in error logs
- **Review-Driven Development**: AI assistant collaboration provides iterative improvement from basic fixes to optimization
- **Helper Function Elimination**: Remove error-hiding utilities (`ignoreError`) to enforce explicit handling
- **Log Efficiency**: Balance between debugging information and log volume (proto type names vs full messages)

## System Robustness Through Panic Elimination

**Discovery**: Strategic panic removal requires systematic categorization and staged approach

### Decision Criteria for panic vs error return

- Programming errors (type violations, impossible states) → panic or log + graceful degradation
- Runtime conditions (invalid input, configuration errors) → error return
- External package code → preserve original behavior

### Implementation Strategy

- **Library Code Principles**: Avoid panics in library code, provide callers with choices
- **Systematic Approach**: Use `rg "panic\("` to scan → categorize by file/purpose → prioritize by impact
- **Parallel Development**: Consider PR conflicts when multiple issues address overlapping code areas
- **Consistency Patterns**: Maintain unified structured logging (slog) for better caller control

## Resource Management in Batch Processing

**Discovery**: Proper resource cleanup requires careful defer placement and lifecycle management

- **defer Timing**: Place defer statements immediately after successful resource creation, not after subsequent operations
- **Batch Processing Complexity**: Partitioned query processing involves multiple goroutines sharing resources, requiring careful lifecycle management
- **Architecture Pattern**: Long-lived resources like `batchROTx` need both `Cleanup()` and `Close()` calls in proper sequence
- **Systematic Review**: Audit defer statement placement by checking if resource creation and cleanup reservation are adjacent
- **Error Path Safety**: Ensure cleanup occurs even when errors happen in subsequent processing steps

## Systematic Code Quality Improvement

**Discovery**: Re-enabling linters after fixing warnings often reveals additional hidden issues not in original scope

### Linter Re-enablement Workflow

1. Fix reported warnings
2. Run `make lint`
3. Fix newly revealed warnings
4. Re-enable in `.golangci.yml`
5. Verify with final `make lint` run

### Key Practices

- **Multiple Lint Run Requirement**: Critical practice when re-enabling linters as fixes can expose previously hidden warnings
- **Staticcheck Warning Categories**: QF series (optimization quick fixes), ST series (Go style compliance) - address by category for consistency

## Context and Session Management Architecture

**Discovery**: Centralized context management prevents race conditions and improves resource lifecycle control

### Design Patterns

- **Statement Type Assertion**: Using type assertion on `Statement` interface allows differentiated timeout behavior based on operation type
- **Integration Test Considerations**: Long-running integration tests need explicit timeout configuration (1h) to prevent false failures during CI
- **System Variable Sharing**: MCP server tests require careful system variable instance sharing between CLI and Session to maintain state consistency
- **Backward Compatibility Strategy**: Preserve existing defaults for specific operations (PDML 24h) while introducing new general defaults (10m)

### Development Process

- **Review-Driven Improvement**: AI assistant collaboration (Gemini Code Assist) provides valuable feedback for validation patterns and code clarity
- **Context Lifecycle Management**: Context cancellation must align with resource lifecycle - centralize timeout application at statement execution boundary, not at individual operation level

## Quick Command Reference

Common commands used during development:

```bash
# Quick tests during development
go test -short ./...        # Unit tests only
make lint                   # Linter only  
make test && make lint      # Full validation

# Development cycle
make build                  # Build the application
make fasttest              # Quick tests during development
make clean                 # Clean artifacts when needed

# Help documentation updates
bin/spanner-mycli-dev docs update-help    # Generate help output for README.md
```

## AI-Friendly Tool Development (Issue #301 Insights)

### Key Design Principles Discovered

**1. stdin/heredoc vs Temporary Files**
AI assistants strongly prefer stdin input over temporary file creation:
```bash
# Preferred pattern (AI-friendly)
echo "Multi-line content" | bin/gh-helper threads reply THREAD_ID

# Avoid this pattern (requires file system operations)
cat > /tmp/content.txt << EOF
Content here
EOF
tool --file /tmp/content.txt
rm /tmp/content.txt
```

**2. Self-Documenting Tool Design**
Comprehensive `--help` output is critical for AI tool discovery and usage:
- Include usage examples in help text
- Document all input methods (stdin, flags, etc.)
- Provide context about when to use each command

**3. Module Organization Strategy**
Unified Go module for development tools (`github.com/apstndb/spanner-mycli/dev-tools`) proved superior to separate modules:
- Simplifies dependency management
- Reduces build complexity
- Enables easier cross-tool integration

**4. Generic vs Project-Specific Separation**
Clear separation between generic GitHub operations (`gh-helper`) and project-specific tools (`spanner-mycli-dev`) improves:
- Code reusability across projects
- Maintenance clarity  
- AI assistant understanding of tool scope

**5. Build System Integration**
Makefile targets that wrap new tools maintain familiar workflows while leveraging modern tooling underneath.

### Implementation Patterns

**GraphQL Error Handling**
When working with GitHub GraphQL API, avoid including optional fields that cause null responses:
```go
// CRITICAL: Do NOT include pullRequestReviewId - causes failures
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "$THREAD_ID"
    body: "$REPLY_TEXT"
  }) { ... }
}
```

**State Management for Review Monitoring**
Review state tracking in `~/.cache/spanner-mycli-reviews/` enables incremental monitoring without API rate limit issues.
